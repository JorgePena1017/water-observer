# water-observer
This system of devices will collect data from bodies of water to later analyze the data and detect patterns (possibly using AI later on). These patterns and data could be used to help look for changes in a body of water that could cause environmental stress. The data could also help the fishery industry best identify the best periods to go harvest. On docks serving as guides telling you where the current and wind will take you. Could also be implemented in boat lifts to lift or lower the boat depending on the tide levels while allowing for efficient boarding and deploying. The size and price of the device will make it possible to install it in every waterfront property across the country, which will lead to a cumulation of data that will create an increase in accuracy of predictions nationwide.   

What will the device measure? 
  •	Tide Levels (LOW, HIGH)
  •	Barometric Pressure
  •	Wind Speed
  •	Wind Direction
  •	Water Temperature
  •	Water flow (Current Speed)
  •	Tide Directions (Outgoing, Ingoing)
  •	Water Clarity*
  •	Water Salinity*

What sensors will be used?
  Underwater:
    •	Clear Turbine Water Flow Sensor with 3-pin JST
    •	Waterproof 1-Wire DS18B20 Digital temperature sensor
  Above Water:
    •	Photoelectric Water / Liquid Level Sensor
    •	BMP388 - Precision Barometric Pressure and Altimeter
